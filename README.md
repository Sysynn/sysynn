# Hi there!
**I'm a full-stack developer (wannabe) and web page designer.**<br>

I'm a very new software engineer and currently taking a full-stack developer course. Fortunately, I have had a lot of interesting experiences in many countries. Hope to be able to create webpages and apps with them.

# I was...
I was a shipping fuel oil bunker trader. 
And wanted to do something new, I flew to Colombia, and started a cafe business. 
Unfortunately, I closed it in just one year since Covid situation came. I decided to be a digital nomad. 

and also I'm a Korean language tutor, have tought more than 80 students from 24 countries. 

# My plan
Currently I'm fully into learning software engineering. First step is python. And then I'm planning to learn about JavaScript, React, etc...
